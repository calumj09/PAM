Our why & purpose 
To help overwhelmed new mums manage the mental load of early motherhood with personalised timelines, reminders, government admin help (all in one simple app).

Mums lack organisational skills, they are busy, tired and stressed and we want this app to be their one stop shop. 

Mums often lack organisational support, are busy, tired, and stressed. We want this app to be their one-stop companion.

 
Onboarding + Baby profile setup
Personalised from the start, so mum only sees what’s relevant. We want to pre-fill appointments/reminders that are due based on their date of birth (they can edit the schedules based on when they actually book it in). 
Features:
●	Account creation (email, Apple ID, Google)
●	Baby's due date or date of birth
●	Single Baby or Twins
●	Gender (Female, Male, Prefer not to say)

●	Feeding method (breastfeeding, bottle, mixed)
●	Birth type (vaginal, c-section)
●	State (to localise healthcare tasks in Australia)
●	Optional: Partner/co-parent info for shared access
Outcome: A personalised dashboard with only the relevant tasks, reminders, and tips.

🧠 Smart UX Enhancements (Expanded)
1. ✅ “Me Time” Nudges
Encouragements and reminders that prioritize the mum's own wellbeing—not just the baby’s.
Purpose:
New mums often neglect self-care due to the mental load of parenting. “Me Time” nudges serve as gentle reminders to take care of themselves, which contributes to emotional resilience and prevents burnout.
Examples of “Me Time” Nudges:
●	“You haven’t logged a nap or rest today — take 10 mins to recharge 💆‍♀️.”

●	“You’re doing a great job — remember to hydrate and eat.”

●	“It’s okay to pause. Want to schedule 15 mins just for you?”

Trigger Points:
●	Based on usage data (e.g., if mum hasn’t opened the app in 24 hrs)

●	After high activity (lots of logs)

●	Weekly “You-time” summaries

Implementation Options:
●	In-app pop-ups

●	Home tab reminders

●	Optional journal/diary space (“How are you feeling today?”)
2. ✅ Smart Suggestions
Personalized, proactive prompts based on baby’s age, regional tasks, and checklist activity.
Purpose:
 Rather than waiting for the mum to check the checklist, the app nudges her at the right moment with task-based suggestions.
Examples of Smart Suggestions:
●	“You’re due for your 6-week GP check — would you like to book it now?”

●	“Your child turns 4 months next week — time to plan for immunisations.”

●	“No Centrelink updates yet — want to recheck your documents?”

Based on:
●	Baby’s DOB

●	Geographic location (e.g., VIC health check reminders)

●	Previously completed tasks

●	Calendar sync data (e.g., no appointment booked yet)

Delivery:
●	Home screen banners

●	Push notifications

●	Weekly digest email
