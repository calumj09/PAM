# Development Notes

## Authentication Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All authentication implementations must include sign-out/logout functionality.

### Required Features:
- âœ… Sign-in/Login
- âœ… Sign-up/Registration  
- ðŸš¨ **Sign-out/Logout** (MUST IMPLEMENT)
- âœ… Session Management
- âœ… Password Reset

### Current Status:
The PAM app currently has sign-in and sign-up functionality via Supabase Auth, but **lacks visible sign-out functionality** in the UI.

### Action Required:
1. **Frontend**: Add sign-out button/link in navigation or user menu
2. **Backend**: Ensure Supabase auth sign-out is properly implemented
3. **Security**: Clear all sessions, cookies, and local storage on sign-out

### Implementation Notes:
- Use Supabase's `signOut()` method
- Clear client-side storage
- Redirect to login page after sign-out
- Provide clear visual indication of sign-out option

This requirement has been added to both frontend and backend SuperClaude workflow documentation to ensure all future development includes proper authentication flows.

## Workflow Documentation Updates

The following workflow documentation has been updated with sign-out requirements:

1. **Frontend Workflow**: `/documentation/workflows/frontend-workflow/superclaude_setup_guide_frontend.md`
   - Added to critical rules
   - Added to quality standards

2. **Backend Workflow**: `/documentation/workflows/backend-workflow/superclaude_setup_guide_backend.md`
   - Added to critical rules
   - Added comprehensive authentication requirements section
   - Added security considerations for logout implementation

These updates ensure all development teams implement complete authentication flows including secure sign-out functionality.
