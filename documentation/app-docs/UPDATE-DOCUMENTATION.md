## ðŸ”„ Changes Implemented

### 1. Emoji Removal Throughout the App

**Implementation:**
- Complete removal of emoji characters from user-facing text and UI components
- Replaced emoji-based icons with professional Lucide React icon system
- Maintained visual hierarchy through consistent iconography

**Files Modified:**
- All component files transitioned from emoji (ðŸŽ¯, ðŸ“…, ðŸ‘¶, etc.) to Lucide React icons
- Navigation components now use `@heroicons/react` for consistent visual language
- Activity timeline uses text-based abbreviations (BF, BT, SF) instead of emoji icons

**User Impact:**
- More professional appearance suitable for healthcare contexts
- Improved compatibility across different devices and operating systems
- Enhanced accessibility for screen readers and assistive technologies

### 2. Dynamic User Name Implementation

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/lib/hooks/use-selected-child.ts
export function useSelectedChild() {
  const [selectedChild, setSelectedChild] = useState<Child | null>(null)
  // Auto-select logic and localStorage persistence
  const selectChild = (child: Child) => {
    setSelectedChild(child)
    localStorage.setItem('selectedChildId', child.id)
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- Automatic child selection for single-child families
- Multi-child selection with localStorage persistence
- Dynamic name insertion throughout the interface
- Context-aware messaging (e.g., "Use the quick entry buttons above to start tracking {childName}'s activities")

**User Experience:**
- Personalized interface that addresses the child by name
- Seamless switching between multiple children in family accounts
- Remembers last selected child across app sessions

### 3. Navigation Updates

**Changes Made:**
- **Admin Help** â†’ **Local Info**: More descriptive and contextually relevant
- **Baby Log** â†’ **Tracker**: Simplified terminology aligned with modern app conventions

**Navigation Structure:**
```typescript
const navItems = [
  { href: '/dashboard/today', label: 'Today' },
  { href: '/dashboard/checklist', label: 'Timeline' },
  { href: '/dashboard/calendar', label: 'Calendar' },
  { href: '/dashboard/info', label: 'Local Info' }, // Changed from Admin Help
  { href: '/dashboard/tracker', label: 'Tracker' },  // Changed from Baby Log
]
```

**User Benefits:**
- Clearer navigation labels reduce cognitive load
- Improved information architecture
- Better alignment with user mental models

### 4. Timeline Component Improvements

**Enhanced Features:**
- **Australian Time Format**: Uses 'en-AU' locale for 12-hour time display
- **Activity Categorization**: Color-coded categories with professional styling
- **Duration Display**: Smart formatting (minutes/hours) with abbreviated labels
- **Empty State Messaging**: Empathetic guidance for new users

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
const formatTime = (dateString: string) => {
  return new Date(dateString).toLocaleTimeString('en-AU', {
    hour: '2-digit',
    minute: '2-digit',
    hour12: true
  })
}
```

**Visual Improvements:**
- Clean card-based layout with subtle border accents
- Consistent 2xl border radius for modern appearance
- Touch-friendly delete buttons with proper spacing
- Professional icon system replacing emoji representations

### 5. Australian English Localization

**Comprehensive Implementation:**
- **Government Resources**: State-specific information for all 8 states/territories
- **Healthcare Integration**: Australian medical terminology and phone numbers
- **Emergency Contacts**: 13 11 14, Poisons Information Centre, state-specific hospitals
- **Terminology**: "Mum" instead of "Mom", "Nappy" instead of "Diaper"

**Resource Coverage:**
```typescript
// Complete coverage for all Australian states
export const stateResources: StateResources[] = [
  'New South Wales', 'Victoria', 'Queensland', 'Western Australia',
  'South Australia', 'Tasmania', 'Australian Capital Territory', 'Northern Territory'
]
```

**Healthcare Standards:**
- WHO percentile charts used by Australian GPs
- Metric measurements (cm, kg, mL)
- Australian immunization schedule integration
- NHMRC guideline compliance

### 6. Mobile-First Enhancements

**Touch Target Optimization:**
```typescript
// Minimum 44px touch targets for accessibility
const selectTriggerVariants = cva(
  "flex h-11 min-h-[44px] w-full items-center justify-between..."
)
```

**Responsive Design Features:**
- `safe-area-pb` class for iPhone notch compatibility
- Bottom navigation fixed positioning for thumb accessibility
- Optimized card layouts for mobile interaction
- Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities with offline support

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Service worker implementation for offline functionality
- Efficient caching strategies using Workbox
- Optimized bundle splitting and code loading
