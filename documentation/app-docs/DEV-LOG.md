# PAM Development Log

## Session: July 27, 2025

### Issue Resolved: Onboarding Wizard "Pay to Start" Error
**Problem**: User reported error during wizard submission showing "An error occurred" after completing onboarding
**Root Cause**: Database schema mismatch - onboarding tried to insert columns that don't exist in base schema
**Solution**: Modified `/src/app/(auth)/onboarding/page.tsx` to only use basic columns that exist in base schema

#### Changes Made:
1. Removed extended column insertion attempts (baby_type, gender, birth measurements, etc.)
2. Simplified profile update to avoid `updated_at` column issues
3. Kept only essential columns: user_id, name, date_of_birth, is_premium_feature

#### Files Modified:
- `/src/app/(auth)/onboarding/page.tsx` (lines 105-175)

### Current Project Status (from PAM-MASTER-PLAN.md)

#### âœ… Recently Completed Features:
- Design System Overhaul (migrated to Lucide React + shadcn/ui)
- Today Page Optimization (empathetic messaging, mobile-first)
- Component Upgrades (Calendar, Document Manager, AI Helper, Admin Wizards)
- Onboarding wizard with error handling

#### ðŸ”„ Next Phase Priorities (Immediate 1-2 weeks):

1. **Timeline Tab Enhancement** (Core differentiator)
   - Weekly card-based layout per planning
   - "What to expect" milestone bubbles
   - Australian-specific admin task integration
   - Auto-generated based on baby's DOB + state

2. **PWA Optimization**
   - Offline support for core features
   - Install prompt for home screen access
   - Background sync for notifications
   - Service worker implementation

3. **Premium Feature Polish**
   - Calendar sync integration (Google/Apple/Outlook)
   - Advanced AI Helper capabilities
   - Family sharing functionality

### Technical Notes

#### Database Schema Issues:
- Base schema in `/database/schema.sql` only has basic columns
- Extended columns exist in migration `/supabase/migrations/20240125000008_add_baby_profile_columns.sql`
- Migration needs to be run for full functionality
- Current solution works without migrations by using only basic columns

#### Key Project Structure:
